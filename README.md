# Velocity: gold rush

Asteroids will always stand out as a special game during my childhood. I learned to love it in the arcade spending many quarters. Then later it came with the Atari 2600, the first arcade game we could play at home other than Pong.

I spent hundreds of hours playing, so it is not so surprising it is the inspiration for a new type of game I designed based on the same controls. In Velocity: gold rush, you play a space prospector who is on a mission to mine gold and other minerals from asteroids. Part of the challenge is the vastness of space compared to the size of your small ship. It takes concentration, quick reflexes and an instinct for controlling the velocity of your ship to collect gold ore while avoiding death.
