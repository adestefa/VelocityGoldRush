# Velocity: gold rush

Asteroids will aways stand out as a special game during my childhood.

I spent hundreds of hours playing, so it is not so surprising it is the inspiration for a new type of game based on the same controls. In Velocity: gold rush, you play a space prospector who is on a mission to mine gold and other minerals from asteroids. Part of the challenge is the vastness of space compared to your small ship. It takes concentration, quick reflexes and an instinct for controlling the velocity of your ship to collect gold ore and avoid death.
